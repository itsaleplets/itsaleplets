### Hi there 👋 It's nice to have you here!

- 🌱 About me:
   - Originally from Amazonas but with northeast roots, I'm a backpacker and nature lover who thinks being able to connect to a higher power through nature is one of the greatest gifts I ever got, alongside with being a wanderlust ✨
   - I'm working as an Integration Engineer at Loadsmart and hope to be traveling soon!

- So far I've done a few front and backend projects using React.js, Node.js, MongoDB and MySQL. I'm currently learning python 🐍 but, judge all you want, JS is still my high school sweetheart 💛 Also, I'd love to collaborate in future projects. 
   

- How to reach me:
  - Email: itsalematos@hotmail.com 📫 
  - Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandraplets/ 
  
      💬 I like meeting new people, so send me a message and let's get in touch 👯💬

- ⚡ Fun fact: I live surrounded by rivers but I can't swim! Ironic, huh? ⚡

### Thanks for reading! Hope to hear from you soon! 👋
