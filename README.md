   - I'm working as a Backend Engineer at Loadsmart 🚛
   - So far I've done a few front and backend projects using React.js, Node.js, MongoDB and MySQL. I'm currently learning python 🐍 but, judge all you want, JS is still my high school sweetheart 💛 Also, I'd love to collaborate in future projects.
